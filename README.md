# RP2350-One / RP2040-One Portable Case

## Introduction

This project provides an improved 3D-printed case for the RP2350-One and RP2040-One development boards.

This design is an optimization of an existing case, with the **key highlight being its improved lanyard hole and keychain loop**. This significantly enhances the device's portability and flexibility for everyday use, allowing you to carry your development board more securely and conveniently.

## Core Features

*   **Wide Compatibility:** Designed for the **Waveshare** RP2350-One and RP2040-One.
*   **Ultimate Portability:** Features an integrated lanyard hole and keychain loop, making it easy to attach to a backpack, keychain, or neck strap.
*   **Physical Protection:** Provides basic protection for the development board against minor bumps and dust from daily use.
*   **Easy to Print and Assemble:** Simple, 3D-print-friendly design that requires no screws.
